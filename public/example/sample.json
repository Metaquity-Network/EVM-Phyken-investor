After 12 months have passed, any individual or entity, regardless of accreditation status, can buy or sell in the auction process.</p>",
        "riskFactor": "<p>Although revenues are contracted and the assets in the Rocket Forest Solar Farm have a history of stable production of over 95%, no investment is without risk. Investors are encouraged to do their own research on the asset class and analyze the data given.</p><p><br/><strong>Factors to consider:</strong></p><p><strong>Business Risk:</strong> Equity investments carry a higher business risk than debt investments. No returns are guaranteed. Neither the issuer nor its intermediaries make any promises, warranties, or guarantees of the financial performance of the Rocket Forest Solar Farm.</p><p><br><strong>Liquidity Risk:</strong> Investing in alternative infrastructure assets is unlike investing in public equities, such as stocks traded on national exchanges. Liquidity, or the ability to sell securities to a counterparty at a reasonable price, is not guaranteed.</p><p><br><strong>Operating Expense:</strong> This is the largest variable in projected returns. A solar facility's operating expenses can be variable. Components may fail or be damaged, or require excessive maintenance and troubleshooting. Today, insurance in the solar industry is undergoing a massive reevaluation of premiums in light of recent large climate-related claims on projects unrelated to those by Rocket Forest Solar Farm or the Rocket Forest Solar Farm. The escalation of insurance premiums may outpace the modeled 3% annually. These factors may significantly increase operating costs beyond the modeled historical averages.</p><p><br><strong>Energy Production:</strong> Energy production varies by three means: irradiance, weather, and degradation. Irradiance varies seasonally with the day's length and the sun's angle. This variation is well understood and modeled accurately and is not a material risk factor. Weather is a substantial driver in energy production as cloud cover and unforeseeable factors such as smoke from wildfires and soiling from dust events affect the energy generated. If cloud cover exceeds the historical averages, production will be lower, and the return to equity will be less than what is modeled. Conversely, less cloud cover than historic averages will enhance output beyond what is modeled. Degradation is the third driver in energy production. Solar panels degrade a small amount yearly as the equipment 'wears down.' The industry standard assumption for the amount of degradation is 0.5% annually. If the actual degradation of the solar panels in the Rocket Forest Solar Farm is greater, equity returns will be impacted.</p><p><br><strong>Counterparty Risk:</strong> Although revenues are contracted, the risk exists that the contracted entities do not pay. This is known as counterparty risk. The Rocket Forest Solar Farm has a strong payment history, with over half of the contracted revenues being with an 'Investment Grade' purchaser. Counterparty risks exist between the power off-takers and other intermediaries such as insurance providers, O&M contractors, and payment distribution.</p><p><br><strong>Depreciation:</strong> Assets within the Rocket Forest Solar Farm will experience depreciation as they approach the end of their useful life.</p><p><br><br><strong>Management Risk:</strong> The team at the helm of the Rocket Forest Solar Farm has over 15 years of experience owning and operating solar projects and assets such as these; however, as with any infrastructure asset, investors face the risk of mismanagement by the managing member. Investors rely on the managing member to serve all members and the asset's best interests. Investors are passive in the Rocket Forest Solar Farm and do not have operational influence (they can only influence major decisions). The risk exists that the managing member, using their best judgment, may make operational decisions that may negatively affect returns. The managing member may make decisions that do not align with investors' opinions.</p><p><br><strong>Climate Change:</strong> The planet is undergoing a 'climate crisis' affecting nearly every industry, sovereign government, and asset class. Predominantly, climate change has broad-reaching effects on weather and climate. The long-term local impacts of climate change are tough to predict with any degree of accuracy. For example, the effects of climate change may cause an increase in cloud, dust, and smoke cover for the assets in the Rocket Forest Solar Farm. This may cause a decrease in projected yield. Climate change risks include losing one or many assets in the Rocket Forest Solar Farm through a convective weather event such as hail or tornado damage. The assets in the Rocket Forest Solar Farm are insured for their value, but a total loss from a convective weather event would significantly impact returns.</p><p><br><strong>Inflation:</strong> In recent years, leading up to and exceeding after the 2020 pandemic, sovereign-backed fiat currency administrators have undertaken loose monetary policy to bolster economic growth. This has resulted in dramatic inflation rates across fiat currencies globally. Continued loose monetary policy and inflation may contribute to devaluing contracted revenues associated with the Rocket Forest Solar Farm. Inflation may also increase operating expenses beyond what is modeled. The effects of such devaluation from inflation are not modeled.</p>"
